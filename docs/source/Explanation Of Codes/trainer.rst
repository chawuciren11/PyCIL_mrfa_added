trainer.py
===============

This python script manages the setup, execution, and logging of the training process,
ensuring that experiments are reproducible and well-documented.

* **train(args)** This function is responsible for initiating the training processacross various configurations defined by different seeds and devices.

* **\_train(args)** This function manages the detailed setup and execution of the training process.It begins by initializing the number of initial classes, setting up the log directoryand configuring the logging.The data manager and model are initialized based on the provided arguments.The function then enters a loop over the tasks,where it performs incremental training, evaluates the model and logs the results.

* **\_set\_device(args)** This function configures the device settings for the training process.It determines whether to use CPU or GPU based on the device type specified in the arguments.

* **\_set\_random** This function sets random seeds for PyTorch to ensure reproducibility of experiments.

* **print\_args(args)** This function logs all the arguments used for the training process.It iterates through the arguments and logs each key-value pair.
